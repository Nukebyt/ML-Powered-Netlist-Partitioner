## Minimal, Streamlit-deployable requirements (no local file URLs)
#
# IMPORTANT: this file must NOT contain entries like "package @ file:///...".
# Such entries reference local build artifacts that are not available to Streamlit's
# build environment and will cause errors like "OSError: No such file or directory".

# Core runtime dependencies (pure-Python)
streamlit>=1.15
networkx>=3.0
matplotlib>=3.5
numpy>=1.24
filelock==3.20.0
torch
torch-geometric
# NOTE about PyTorch / PyG:
# PyTorch and PyTorch-Geometric require platform-specific wheels. Install them
# manually on the host (or via a Docker image) rather than listing them directly
# in requirements.txt when deploying to hosts that don't provide matching binaries.
# See:
#  - https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
#  - https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html
